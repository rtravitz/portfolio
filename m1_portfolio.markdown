## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project focused on using an iterative development process. Through this process, I learned about how to break programs into logical components, test those components in isolation and combination, and utilize classes. I also learned how to create a linked list data structure.

**Evaluation Comments:**

* All iterations plus both extensions
* Well tested, but check older tests, make sure tests actually test your intent.
* Used both recursion and iterative approaches.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

*Test-Driven Development:* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Looping or Recursion:* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

-----------------

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

For this project, I created an interactive querying and reporting tool that could handle messy datasets. The program implemented a REPL that a user could query for information about attendees to an event. The user could then generate CSV and HTML reports from saved searches.

**Evaluation Comments:**

* 20 tests
* Used Faraday
* Overall, really good project, extensions complete.
* Look for more ways to test both happy and sad paths.
* Great instinct on how to handle testing messages printed to screen.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions, or a custom extension to be approved by an instructor.

*REPL Interface:* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface

*Test-Driven Development:* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

*Breaking Logic into Components:* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Enumerables and Collections:* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

*HTML and Style:* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)


#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganslimak/Complete_Me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

This project focused on making a simple textual autocomplete system. To finish this project, my partner and I implemented the trie data structure and used File I/O to populate it with a dictionary of roughly 250,000 words. When presented with a fragment of a word, the program would suggest all possible completions and weight suggestions by past usage. As an extension to the project, we also made a simple GUI with Shoes.

**Evaluation Comments:**

* great test coverage
* good use of recursion where necessary
* separated responsibilities and use of private methods

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

*Test-Driven Development:* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

*Enumerable & Collections:* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
