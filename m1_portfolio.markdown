# Ryan Travitz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Academically, this module I sought to gain a solid understanding of Ruby and Object-Oriented principles to rely on in the future.

I also set personal goals to immerse myself in every part of the Turing experience. It's important to me to commit to things all the way. In this context, that meant focusing on attending as many speakers and events as possible, jumping into a posse, and bonding with my cohort.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of the first six week at Turing, I have had the opportunity to work on two individual projects: Jungle Beat and Event Reporter. I received threes and fours across both projects. From the first project to the second project, I grew in my ability to separate parts of my logic and test them separately and together.

-----------

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project focused on using an iterative development process. Through this process, I learned about how to break programs into logical components, test those components in isolation and combination, and utilize classes. I also learned how to create a linked list data structure.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mike

* All iterations plus both extensions
* Well tested, but check older tests, make sure tests actually test your intent.
* Used both recursion and iterative approaches.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

*Test-Driven Development:* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Looping or Recursion:* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

-----------------

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

For this project, I created an interactive querying and reporting tool that could handle messy datasets. The program implemented a REPL that a user could query for information about attendees to an event. The user could then generate CSV and HTML reports from saved searches.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mike

* 20 tests
* Used Faraday
* Overall, really good project, extensions complete.
* Look for more ways to test both happy and sad paths.
* Great instinct on how to handle testing messages printed to screen.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions, or a custom extension to be approved by an instructor.

*REPL Interface:* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface

*Test-Driven Development:* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

*Breaking Logic into Components:* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Enumerables and Collections:* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

*HTML and Style:* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Beyond just improving technical abilities, group projects at Turing are an excellent opportunity to grow in important communication and interpersonal skills.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganslimak/Complete_Me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

This project focused on making a simple textual autocomplete system. To finish this project, my partner and I implemented the trie data structure and used File I/O to populate it with a dictionary of roughly 250,000 words. When presented with a fragment of a word, the program would suggest all possible completions and weight suggestions by past usage. As an extension to the project, we also made a simple GUI with Shoes.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mark

* great test coverage
* good use of recursion where necessary
* separated responsibilities and use of private methods

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

*Test-Driven Development:* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

*Enumerable & Collections:* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback


*-For Morgan Slimak:*

I appreciated working with Morgan on CompleteMe. Beyond his ability to program, Morgan brought admirable work ethic and personal flexibility to the project. At all times, Morgan was ready to jump in and work and was open to working together or separately on any part of the project. Working with Morgan was just an easy and enjoyable experience, and I hope to have the chance to be on a team with him again.


*-For Jon Kimble:*

Jon is a personal inspiration to me at Turing because of the way that he carries himself and interacts with others. I am particularly impressed by his ability to tackle things that I find daunting such as interacting with existing members of the tech community. By the end of this module, Jon will have already been to multiple events in the area and started tentatively looking at the job market. I have no doubt that he will excel in this area because of his natural ability to authentically engaging with any individual’s interests. I think everyone at Turing could learn something from his example.


*-For Dan Olson:*

I had the opportunity to work with Dan on Headcount, affectionately described on its Github template repo as "a whopper of a project." Throughout what was sometimes a trying experience, Dan was a very supportive partner. I appreciated his work ethic and flexibility. But more than anything else, I was impressed by Dan’s communication. We re-DTR’d several times—not for anything negative, but rather just to make sure that we remained on the same page. Without his commitment to communicating clearly and effectively, I’m sure our partnership would not have gone as smoothly.  


### Being a Community Member


*-From Jon Kimble*

Ryan has been a huge help to me during my time at Turing, he has always made himself available to answer any questions I or my teammates may have.  He has a calm and conversational way of explaining concepts that leaves me walking away with understanding what is going on rather than just with an answer. He also shows great dedication to all of his work at Turing and this serves as a continued inspiration.  It is very motivating to see his focus, the high standard of performance he holds himself to, and the quality of work he produces. Ryan is a great guy to be around and adds to all of our experience at Turing in numerous ways.


### Playing a Part

During Module 1, I have attended all Turing functions, including guest speakers, Gear-ups, mixers, and various Pahlka Posse gatherings.

I also try to empower myself to improve our community whenever I see something that I can fix or improve. This module, that ended up being small things like taking over cleaning duties when one member of the cohort had to leave to pick up his kids from school or grabbing a broom and dustpan to sweep up broken glass from a bottle that smashed down the back staircase over the weekend.

Next module, I hope to continue my involvement and in particular start to raise it by participating with more groups like Kids Who Code.
