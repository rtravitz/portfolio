# Ryan Travitz - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Academically, this module I sought to gain a solid understanding of Ruby and Object-Oriented principles to rely on in the future.

I also set personal goals to immerse myself in every part of the Turing experience. It's important to me to commit to things all the way. In this context, that meant focusing on attending as many speakers and events as possible, jumping into a posse, and bonding with my cohort.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Over the course of the first six week at Turing, I have had the opportunity to work on two individual projects: Jungle Beat and Event Reporter. I received threes and fours across both projects. From the first project to the second project, I grew in my ability to separate parts of my logic and test them separately and together.

-----------

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project focused on using an iterative development process. Through this process, I learned about how to break programs into logical components, test those components in isolation and combination, and utilize classes. I also learned how to create a linked list data structure.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mike

* All iterations plus both extensions
* Well tested, but check older tests, make sure tests actually test your intent.
* Used both recursion and iterative approaches.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

*Test-Driven Development:* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Looping or Recursion:* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

-----------------

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

For this project, I created an interactive querying and reporting tool that could handle messy datasets. The program implemented a REPL that a user could query for information about attendees to an event. The user could then generate CSV and HTML reports from saved searches.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mike

* 20 tests
* Used Faraday
* Overall, really good project, extensions complete.
* Look for more ways to test both happy and sad paths.
* Great instinct on how to handle testing messages printed to screen.

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions, or a custom extension to be approved by an instructor.

*REPL Interface:* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface

*Test-Driven Development:* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

*Breaking Logic into Components:* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Enumerables and Collections:* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

*HTML and Style:* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Beyond just improving technical abilities, group projects at Turing are an excellent opportunity to grow in important communication and interpersonal skills.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/morganslimak/Complete_Me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

This project focused on making a simple textual autocomplete system. To finish this project, my partner and I implemented the trie data structure and used File I/O to populate it with a dictionary of roughly 250,000 words. When presented with a fragment of a word, the program would suggest all possible completions and weight suggestions by past usage. As an extension to the project, we also made a simple GUI with Shoes.

**Evaluation Comments:**

Assessed by: Mark

* great test coverage
* good use of recursion where necessary
* separated responsibilities and use of private methods

**Evaluation Scores:**

*Functional Expectations:* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

*Test-Driven Development:* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

*Fundamental Ruby & Style:* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

*Enumerable & Collections:* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### Being a Community Member


Ryan has been a huge help to me during my time at Turing, he has always made himself available to answer any questions I or my teammates may have.  He has a calm and conversational way of explaining concepts that leaves me walking away with understanding what is going on rather than just with an answer. He also shows great dedication to all of his work at Turing and this serves as a continued inspiration.  It is very motivating to see his focus, the high standard of performance he holds himself to, and the quality of work he produces. Ryan is a great guy to be around and adds to all of our experience at Turing in numerous ways.
