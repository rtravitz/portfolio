## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

This project focused on using an iterative development process. Through this process, I learned about how to break programs into logical components, test those components in isolation and combination, and utilize classes. I also learned how to create a linked list data structure.

Evaluation Comments:

* All iterations plus both extensions
* Well tested, but check older tests, make sure tests actually test your intent.
* Used both recursion and iterative approaches.

Evaluation Scores:

Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Looping *or* Recursion

* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
